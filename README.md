Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated lane detection, involving a combination of convolutional, max-pooling, and upsampling layers.  
Leveraged Python libraries including NumPy, Keras, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, neural network implementation, and model evaluation.
